# BookNotes

Welcome to the Book Notes Repository! ðŸ“š This project was created as a capstone for a course, inspired by the idea of retaining key insights from books.



## Overview

I often found myself forgetting the most important parts of books I read, so I started taking notes. This web application allows users to store their book notes, along with ratings. The books are sortable by rating, recency, and title, making it easy to find and revisit your favorite reads.




## Objective

- **Integrate Public APIs:** I learned how to - integrate public APIs into web projects to enhance functionality and access external data.
- **Server-Side Programming:** Utilized Express and Node.js for server-side programming, gaining hands-on experience in building robust server applications.
- **CRUD Operations with PostgreSQL:** Demonstrated proficiency in Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations with a PostgreSQL database to persist data effectively.
## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** Server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js:** Web application framework for Node.js.
- **PostgreSQL:** Open-source relational database management system.
- **HTML5/CSS3:** Markup and styling for the front-end interface.
